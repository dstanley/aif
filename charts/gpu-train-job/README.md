# gpu-train-job

Helm chart that runs one distributed training run as a Kubernetes **Indexed Job** running
`torchrun`, with no Kubeflow dependency, or as a Kubeflow **PyTorchJob**. `questions.yaml` turns it
into a form in **Rancher Apps**.

It is the chart AI Factory's AIJobs install: the operator installs it once per run from the
`gpu-train-charts` ClusterRepo (see [the AIJob design](../../docs/design/aijob.md)), and the training
pages and the [SDK](../../sdk/python) set its values from a profile. A profile's open fields map onto
the values below.

| Layer | How it is covered |
|---|---|
| Pod per node, stable names | Indexed Job + headless Service (`<job>-<index>.<job>.<ns>.svc`) |
| Rank assignment | `--node_rank=$(JOB_COMPLETION_INDEX)`, `--nproc_per_node=<gpusPerNode>` |
| Rendezvous | c10d on pod index 0 (default) or external etcd (`rendezvous.backend=etcd-v2`) |
| NCCL data path | optional Multus attachment (`network.multusNetwork`) + `NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME`, or `network.hostNetwork` + `network.rdma` for an RoCE/InfiniBand fabric |
| Secrets | `storage.secretMounts`: existing Secrets mounted read-only (object-store credentials, an `.s3cfg`, a token file) |
| GPU request | `nvidia.com/gpu` (device plugin), a DRA ResourceClaimTemplate, or a KAI GPU-memory share (`gpu.sharedMemoryMiB`) |
| Scheduling | none / Kueue (queue label, suspended until admitted) / KAI or Run:AI (`schedulerName` + queue label, gang via PodGroup) |
| Storage | scratch (node-local or a per-pod volume), a dataset claim, and a checkpoint volume created per run and kept after it (`storage.checkpointCreate`) |
| Failure | failed index is recreated with the same index; etcd rendezvous re-forms the group |
| Multi-node NVLink domain (rack-scale NVL systems, e.g. GB200/GB300) | `computeDomain.enabled`: one ComputeDomain per run (numNodes = nodes) plus a channel claim per pod, via the NVIDIA DRA driver |

Every pod gets `JOB_NAME`, `NNODES`, `NPROC_PER_NODE`, `NODE_NAME` (the node it runs on), and
`SCRATCH_DIR`, `DATASET_DIR` and `CHECKPOINT_DIR` when those volumes are set.

## Modes

- `smoke` (default): `nvidia-smi`, interface list, hold N seconds. Works with any image, including the
  default (SUSE's BCI base): the NVIDIA container toolkit mounts `nvidia-smi` into a container that
  gets a GPU. Proves scheduling, queue admission, GPU attach and the Multus interface without torch.
- `torchrun`: runs `/workspace/train.py` (inline `job.script`, or the built-in NCCL all-reduce demo)
  under torchrun.
- `custom`: `job.command` / `job.args` verbatim. The test and benchmark profiles in
  [examples/training](../../examples/training) use this mode.

## Examples

```bash
# a smoke test on one GPU, admitted by a Kueue LocalQueue
helm install smoke1 ./charts/gpu-train-job -n team-a \
  --set scheduler.type=kueue --set scheduler.queue=gpu-queue

# 8 nodes x 2 GPUs, NCCL over a Multus network, etcd rendezvous, a KAI queue
helm install run1 ./charts/gpu-train-job -n team-a \
  --set job.mode=torchrun --set job.nodes=8 --set job.gpusPerNode=2 \
  --set network.multusNetwork=team-a/nccl-net \
  --set rendezvous.backend=etcd-v2 --set rendezvous.endpoint=etcd.team-a.svc:2379 \
  --set scheduler.type=kai --set scheduler.queue=team-a

# 4 GiB of a shared GPU under KAI (HAMi-core caps the pod's GPU memory)
helm install dev1 ./charts/gpu-train-job -n team-a \
  --set scheduler.type=kai --set scheduler.queue=team-a --set gpu.sharedMemoryMiB=4096

# a cluster that already runs Run:AI: same queues, different schedulerName. The namespace has to
# be one a run.ai Project owns -- labelling one by hand gets the pods scheduled and then refused
# at bind time. `kubectl get projects.run.ai -o custom-columns=:.status.namespace` lists them.
helm install smoke2 ./charts/gpu-train-job -n runai-training \
  --set scheduler.type=runai --set scheduler.queue=training
```

## RDMA / RoCE

A pod on the cluster network cannot see an RDMA rail, so a fabric run needs three things together:

```yaml
network:
  hostNetwork: true              # the pod gets the node's NICs, and loses its own IP
  rdma:
    enabled: true                # mounts /dev/infiniband, runs privileged, NCCL_IB_DISABLE=0
    hostLibPath: /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu   # only for images without libibverbs
  ncclIbHca: "mlx5_0:1,mlx5_1:1" # both rails -- one HCA is half the width
  ncclIbGidIndex: "3"            # RoCEv2
  ncclNetGdrLevel: "0"           # host staging; raise it where GPUDirect actually works
  ncclCrossNic: "1"
```

`hostNetwork` also means two runs on one node collide on the rendezvous port, and that the pods
answer on the node's address — reasons enough to leave it off for anything the pod network can
carry. A LoRA's gradient is small; a full fine-tune's is not.

## Pre-flight

`scheduler.type=kai` and `scheduler.type=runai` are the same scheduler under two names and must not
be swapped: pick the wrong one and every pod stays `Pending` with no event explaining it. The chart's
pre-flight detects that, a missing queue, and GPUs or DRA devices the cluster does not have, and fails
the install with the reason. It uses `lookup`, so it runs under `helm install`/`upgrade` and
`helm install --dry-run=server`, not under `helm template`. Installed by an AIJob, it runs as the
AI Factory operator, whose ClusterRole grants the reads it needs.

## Tests

```bash
./charts/gpu-train-job/verify-render.sh     # renders the combinations that matter and checks them; no cluster
```
