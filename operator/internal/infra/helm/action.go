// Wait is off, and that is the load-bearing decision. Waiting keeps the
// reconcile context open for the length of the rollout, and that context is the
// manager's, cancelled the instant the pod receives SIGTERM. Upgrading the
// bundled extension is done by `helm upgrade` on the operator's own chart,
// which writes the new version into the CR *and* rolls the operator Deployment
// in one operation: the outgoing pod picks up the CR change, starts this
// upgrade, and is terminated a dozen seconds later when its replacement passes
// its readiness probe. Helm answers a cancelled context by recording the
// revision as `failed: context canceled`, so a routine version bump left a
// failed revision in the history of every extension upgrade whose image was not
// already cached on the node.
//
// Two non-fixes, because both were tried. A longer Timeout does nothing —
// nothing here is timing out. Raising terminationGracePeriodSeconds on its own
// does nothing either: controller-runtime cancels reconcile contexts at SIGTERM,
// at the *start* of the grace period, so a wider one only buys a longer wait
// after the cancellation that already did the damage. What uses that width is
// withShutdownGrace, which keeps the write running past the cancellation; the
// Pod's grace period was widened to cover it, not in place of it.
//
// Wait off is what keeps that grace affordable. Holding the reconcile open for
// the rollout would leave a write in flight for minutes, far past anything a
// shutdown can reasonably wait out; with it off the window is the apply itself,
// seconds.
//
// Readiness is not given up, it changes owner: the controller polls
// kubernetes.IsDeploymentReady and requeues, a wait that resumes after a
// restart because it is held in an annotation rather than a blocked goroutine.
// That check was hardened to `kubectl rollout status` semantics in the same
// change, because until then it counted ready pods — and the previous
// revision's pod is ready throughout a rollout, so it would have called the
// upgrade done the moment the manifest was applied. Turning Wait off without
// that is not a smaller change, it is a silent one: the CR would report
// Installed for a version that is not serving.
