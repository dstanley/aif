// TestUpgradeDoesNotWaitForReadiness pins the fix for a failure mode that only
// appears in a real cluster, so nothing else in this suite can catch a
// regression.
//
// Waiting here holds the reconcile context open for as long as the rollout
// takes. That context is the manager's, cancelled on SIGTERM — and the Helm
// upgrade that bumps the bundled extension is requested by the very `helm
// upgrade` that rolls the operator pod. The outgoing pod therefore starts the
// extension upgrade and is killed roughly twelve seconds later, whereupon
// helm's failRelease stamps the revision `failed: context canceled` and leaves
// it in the release history for good.
//
// Readiness is not dropped by this, it moves: the controller polls
// kubernetes.IsDeploymentReady on a requeue loop, which outlives a restarting
// operator in a way an in-process wait cannot.
